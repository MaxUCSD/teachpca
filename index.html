  <h1>Principal Components Analysis (PCA) Tutorial</h1>
  <h2>An explanation of PCA that will hopefully feel intuitive</h2>
  <dt-byline></dt-byline>

  <p>If you are in neuroscience, well then you have probably seen PCA used before (citations here?), if not, you will. I have had a very difficult time understanding and teaching PCA, this is my attempt to remedy that. This is for anyone who wants to learn what PCA is doing. It is designed for people with very little math background but hopefully there will be new perspectives which anyone, no matter their background in math, can get something out of.  </p>
  <p>  I think it is helpful to start with a question, why would anyone want to use PCA? In my opinion, the most intuitive use for PCA is <em>compression</em>. Ask yourself, no, really, think about it, what is compression? One perspective on compression is that it is the act of retaining only what is necesarry. In music, for example, when you record a song there will be sounds that are recorded which are out of the human range of hearing, we don't need to save those sounds! We are removing redundant or unnescary information. This is all well and good in the case of music, but you're a neuroscientist, not a filthy musician (jokes) so what do you care? I'm glad you asked. 
  </p>

  <p> Before we get to neuroscience applications I want to take a brief detour and ask, on a more philosophical level, what is the goal of data science? I want to illustrate what I think is the goal with an example. 
    Imagine you go out and you ask three people their height and weight. You get back a table which looks like this:  </p>

      <div class="results-table-container">
        <table class="results-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th> </th>
              <th class="number">Height (in) </th>
              <th class="number">Weight (lbs) </th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Phillip</td>
              <td class="number">72</td>
              <td class="number">144</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Jeffrey</td>
              <td class="number">65</td>
              <td class="number">130</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Clarise</td>
              <td class="number">60</td>
              <td class="number">120</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p>What do you notice about this data? You might have noticed that the weight of each person is just twice their height. As a scientist this is exactly the kind of thing I'm excited to find, 
        there is a <em>relationship</em> between height and weight.
         What we once thought were two separate things are actually 
         just the same underlying thing. In other words, 
         we now have a <em>rule</em>: $weight = 2height$, which tells us
         how to go from one to the other. Note that $\frac{weight}{2} = height$, 
         the important point is not the direction; i.e. 
         that you can go from height to weight, 
         but that if I know one, I know the other. 
         This is analagous to, in physics, if you know the initial conditions 
         and the rules of a system you can 
         know what state that system will be in at
         any time point. This is, in some sense, understanding, which is, in some sense, 
         the goal of science. This kind of understanding 
         also implies that we don't need to
         keep all of the information, 
         we only need one number, height or weight, to get both. We have 
         compressed the information using a relationship between them which is exactly
         what PCA tries to do.  
      </p>


      <p> 
        Lets say we wanted to exploit this relationship so that we can keep less data, which number do we pick, the height or the weight?
        In this perfect example, where everyone lies along the line $w = 2h$, 
        it does not matter which of the numbers you keep because there is perfect redundancy. Lets imagine we collected different height and weight data that is not perfectly on the line
        and it looks like this:

      </p>
      <div class="results-table-container">
        <table class="results-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th> </th>
              <th class="number">Height (in) </th>
              <th class="number">Weight (lbs) </th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Phillip</td>
              <td class="number">72</td>
              <td class="number">150</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Jeffrey</td>
              <td class="number">65</td>
              <td class="number">140</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Clarise</td>
              <td class="number">60</td>
              <td class="number">123</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p>
       Let's take a look at what 
       our data looks like when we plot it:
       
       <h2>Height Versus Weight</h2>
       <div class="l-body">
         <div id="Height_Weight_Scatter" style="margin: 20px auto; text-align: center;"></div>
       </div>


  <p>
    Now we have reframed our problem, instead of trying to 
    find the perfect relationship
    to compress our data, let's look for the best (linear) relationship. The problem statement of 
    PCA is essentially: "Find me the line such that we retain as much information about the data as possible". An 
    important thing to note is that we are not trying find a line which helps us predict 
    height from weight (the problem statement of linear regression), we are looking for the line 
    which retains the most information about both height and weight! Then the number you end up with, that you keep, 
    is your position along the line. But what line should we pick, and how do we find where each
    individual data point belongs on the line?
  </p>  

  <p>
    To try to motivate the line we ought to keep, take a look at this data:
  </p>
       
  <h2>Same Height, Different Weights</h2>
  <div class="l-body">
    <div id="Vertical_Scatter" style="margin: 20px auto; text-align: center;"></div>
  </div>

  <p>What number should you keep? Intuitively, 
    weight, right? But, why? Well, 
    if you only kept the height of each person, then you would not 
    be able to tell them apart! The fact that you are only going to 
    keep the weight, implies that the line you need to 
    "maintain the maximum information" is the y-axis. 
    In a sense, what you are doing is
    drawing a line from your points to the y-axis and asking where each point ends up. 
    It's not just any old line either
    it's a line which meets the y-axis at a $90\degree$ angle. 
    In math, we call this, the operation of taking a point and 
    asking where it ends up when you draw the perpendicular line to another line a <em> projection </em>. Take a look:
  </p>

  <h2>Projecting Points to the Y-Axis</h2>
  <div class="l-body">
    <div id="Projection_Scatter" style="margin: 20px auto; text-align: center;"></div>
  </div>

  <p>

    Note that it does not matter that the line we project onto was the y-axis, 
    it could be any line parallel to the y-axis, 
    in that way it's more like you project onto a direction (north in our case).
    Importantly, we did not strictly need 
    to project our data onto the north direction, 
    we could have picked any direction!
  </p>

  <h2>Interactive Projection Demonstration</h2>
  <p>
    Try moving the slider below to change the projection direction. Watch how the projections change, 
    and see how the 1D representation (right plot) changes accordingly.
  </p>
  
  <div style="text-align: center; margin: 10px auto;">
    <label for="angle-slider">Projection Angle: <span id="angle-value">90°</span></label><br>
    <input type="range" id="angle-slider" min="0" max="180" value="90" style="width: 300px;">
  </div>
  
  <div class="interactive-demo">
    <div class="demo-panel">
      <h3>2D Data with Projections</h3>
      <div id="Interactive_Projection" style="margin: 5px auto; text-align: center;"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="demo-panel">
      <h3>1D Compressed Representation</h3>
      <div id="Compressed_Representation" style="margin: 5px auto; text-align: center;"></div>
    </div>
  </div>

  
<p> 

What happens when you move the slider to $90 \degree$? 
All the data points just lie on the same part of the line, they are indistinguishable. 
What if we did not know which direction to pick before hand, 
how would we know, or learn? 
Well we know we don't want to pick the line on which 
the people are indistinguishable. But other than that, as long as we can distinguish everyone, what makes 
one direction better than any other direction? Intuitively, it's a lot better to have a summary number which retains
as much information as possible, this number is variance and it is exactly the spread you see of the points in the 1d compressed
representation. In our example, the direction which maximizes the variance of our data is the north direction. 

<p> 
It's worth taking a breather here and summarizing what we have done so far. 
We started by introducing the concept of compression and noting how a rule which relates 
two things is a natural way of compressing information. Then we introduced the problem statement of 
PCA: "Find me the line such that when we project onto it we retain as much info as possible". 
Then we defined projection as where you end up when you draw a perpendicular line to some direction. 
It's worth noting that if you understand what we've done so far, then you pretty much understand PCA! WHATTTT I hear you ask? 
Yep! That's pretty much it. We're just taking our data and projecting it onto the line or plane (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) which maximizes the variance. 
If you understand that, that's totally enough! In this next section, we're gonna take some time to formalize
what has so far been informal and based on trial and error, but you should feel good about yourself if you understand 
everything we've done so far.
